# Getting started with an awesome Linux setup in three simple steps

1. Buy a Framework laptop (or a System76 desktop) + a USB thumb drive for the installation
2. Follow instructions on how to install Ubuntu 24.04 [https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview] (make sure you pick LZM/encrypted for the drive!)
3. Open the terminal with Ctrl+alt+T and run "wget -O- https://omakub.org/install | bash"
